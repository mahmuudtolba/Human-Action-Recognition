# Human Action Recognition for ADHD Assistance

This project, developed as my graduation requirements, aims to assist children with ADHD in maintaining focus through a structured task called "Prepare Your Bag."

## Project Overview
The "Prepare Your Bag" task is divided into three distinct actions:
1. **Stand**: The child stands up.
2. **Open the Bag**: The child opens their bag.
3. **Put the Book in the Bag**: The child places a book inside the bag.

## Data Collection
The data for this project was meticulously collected by our group, recording videos performing these actions to train our model.
